# Hashrocket / Code Platoon SQL Workshop Agenda

This document outlines the plan for our workshop. All times in Central. We'll
be taking a short break once per hour.

### 0900: Greetings and Reading Review

We'll get to know each other! We will introduce ourselves, and then you'll
introduce yourself.

Then, we'll cover the assigned reading about databases.

### 0945: SQL at the PostgreSQL REPL

Throughout the day, we will create a PostgreSQL database and add to it,
covering the basic SQL commands. Expect a short introduction to the command,
followed by learning how it works via practice.

Some commands and concepts we'll cover:

- `create`
- `select` columns and `*`
- `where`
- `like` and `ilike`
- `insert`
- `null`
- `update`
- `delete`
- Primary keys
- `order`
- `limit`
- `and`
- `or`
- `in`

*General Advice:*

1. Rather than copy-pasting, try typing the commands into `psql`â€” that's the
   fastest way to learn! Tab-complete, `CTRL-R` (search), `CTRL-P` and `CTRL-N`
   (up and down) are how programmers type quickly and accurately.
2. Please maximize your terminal window and your font size! Code should always
   be easy to read.
3. If you get stuck, let us know right away! We want you to succeed today.
4. #1 debugging tip: read the error message.
5. Please ask questions! If something doesn't make sense to you, it's probably
   a point others would learn from, too.

### 1200: Lunch

### 1300: Exercises

We will dive deeper into our database, exploring advanced keywords and working
through more difficult data challenges.

- `offset`
- `join`
- `null` (advanced)
- Aggregate functions

### 1500: Data Modeling Exercises

We will model one or more of the projects described in
[data_modeling/exercise.md][exercise]

### 1600: Q & A

Question and answer time! We'll answer your questions about SQL, programming,
consulting, startups, transitioning from the military into technology, etc.

### 1630: Homework assigned by instructor

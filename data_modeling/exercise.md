# Data Modeling Exercises

This directory contains some BDD-style project stories. Reading through them,
consider: how could we model this data, before writing any code?

- PG Casts
- Hashboard
- University bookstore

We'll be approaching the problem from a story-first (behavioral) perspective,
using the E-R (Entity-Relationship) model.

- What are the Entities (real things in the world we can represent)?
- What are their properties (attributes of the Entities)?
- What are the relationships between each Entity?

We'll be asking practical questions like:

- Does each Entity need to have a table?
- Does this application need a relational database?

### Product Domains

We may explore these and other product domains.

- Hotels
- Military unit or bases
- Timeclock
